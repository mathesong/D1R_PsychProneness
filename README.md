This is the repository containing the analysis code used for our [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/14/321646):

> Matheson G.J., Plav√©n-Sigray P., Louzolo A., Borg J., Farde L., Petrovic P. & Cervenka S. (2018). *Dopamine D1 receptor availability is not associated with delusional ideation measures of psychosis proneness.* bioRxiv.

Some of the data is considered sensitive, and it will not be possible for it to be shared openly due to regulatory restrictions. We are currently in discussions with the institution to ask whether the current interpretation of the regulation can or will be changed. I will upload as much of the data as I can before submission. The raw data which *is* considered to be sensitive is available upon request from the authors.

### Note

Not all data and analysis code has yet been uploaded: I will gradually get it all uploaded.
